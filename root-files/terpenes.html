                <h3>TERPENES</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps the most consequential (yet overlooked!) element in selecting a cannabis product is finding one with the terpene profile that best suits your personal needs and preferences. Terpenes are the main constituents of the cannabis plant responsible for the flavor and aroma of any particular variety/strain. Moreover, they modify the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids and are responsible for many of the cannabis plant's medicinal effects.</p>
                    <p>Limonene, for example, is a terpene commonly known to have antidepressant properties. Jack Herer is one example of a cannabis strain rich in limonene. &beta;-caryophyllene is a terpene that has been found to reduce symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Celebrated and uplifting strain Royal Cookies contains higher levels of &beta;-caryophyllene.</p>
                    <p>When consuming concentrates, it’s important to be mindful of combustion temperature. Terpenes tend to be more sensitive to heat than THC and/or CBD, and can easily be burned off at high dabbing temperatures. If you’re a dabber looking to preserve the terpene profile of your concentrates, stick to low-temperature dabbing!</p>

                <h3>CANNABIS DELIVERY</h3>
                    <p>Cannabis delivery services are local businesses! Supporting a delivery service benefits the community because they serve local cities and the people that reside in them. Depending on where you live, you may have to commute several cities or towns away to purchase cannabis-based products from a storefront dispensary, when your time and money could be better spent going with a local delivery service.</p>
                    <p>Because there is no need to drive when you take advantage of the convenience of home-delivered cannabis products, a delivery service can benefit those with mental and/or physical issues such as depression, anxiety, chemotherapy treatments, seizures, and more. For residents in underserved communities, or those who cannot operate a vehicle for one reason or another, cannabis delivery can be an indispensable service.</p>
                    <p>Cannabis delivery services are safe, convenient and discreet, offering the same top-quality products as any brick-and-mortar storefront dispensary.</p>

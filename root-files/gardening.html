                <h3>SEEDS</h3>
                    <p>Just like any other living thing on Earth, not all cannabis strains are the same. Each one varies in the speed of growth, odor, yield, size, resilience, and cannabinoid/terpene content.</p>
                    <p>When deciding to grow your own cannabis plants, there are many important factors to take into consideration before breaking the soil. The cannabis plant is sexed, meaning seeds can grow into male or female plants. Selecting feminized seeds is recommended if the gardener's intent is to harvest buds for smoking/eating/vaping, etc. because non-feminized seeds have a 50% chance of growing into either male or female plants. Male plants will only produce more seeds, not the flowering buds desired for consumption. Another factor to consider is the difference between autoflowering and photoperiod seeds. Autoflowering means the plant will begin flowering, or "budding," on its own within several weeks of germination. Photoperiod varieties on the other hand, need 12 hours of darkness per day to induce and sustain flowering. They also take longer to grow in general, and unless grown outdoors, the vegetative period is up to the discretion of the gardener.</p>
                <h3>NUTRIENTS</h3>
                    <p>Growing cannabis requires a gardener's full time and attention. Cannabis plants require specific care and nutrients throughout the growth cycle in order to grow into healthy, thriving plants that produce the best-quality flower. Like most vegetation on Earth, they require fresh air, ample light, optimal temperatures, and water.</p>
                    <p>Growing cannabis gets highly nuanced once the consideration of nutrients to feed comes into play. The combination of nutrients fed to your cannabis plants, and at what stage in the growth cycle, will have a significant impact on the quality and yield of your harvest.</p>
                    <p>Plants need a curated balance of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (a.k.a. "N-P-K") among other micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, etc. throughout the growth cycle. The required ratios of these nutrients delicately fluctuate depending on the growth stage (i.e., more nitrogen during vegetative growth, and more phosphorous during late flowering). Experienced gardeners also know that the specific cannabis strains prefer their "own" N-P-K formulations for optimal quality and yield.</p>
                <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
                    <p>Selecting the optimal gardening supplies depends on a number of factors such as cost, availability, and time, but one of the most important determining factors in equipment selection is the location of the garden: indoors or outdoors. Growing indoors requires significantly more hardware because everything elemental must be artificially re-created: light, airflow, temperature, etc. This makes indoor growing a much more expensive endeavor. Options for growing mediums in indoor gardens are more extensive (hydropnic, aeroponic, rockwool, coco coir, etc.), while soil (potted or in-ground) is the most optimal choice for outdoor gardens.</p>
                    <p>Whether growing indoors or outdoors, proper garden drainage is critical. Oversaturation will lead to plant diseases resulting in low yields, poor bud quality, and if left untreated, the death of the entire plant. In hydro- or aeroponic gardens, aerating the water is as significantly important for the same reasons.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, ancillary equipment such as ppm measuring devices, pH-testing kits, trellis nets, etc will become a gardener's best resources. Happy Growing!</p>

                <h3>LITTLE DRAGON DABS&trade;</h3>
                    <p>Join our community of investors and become a shareholder in the next national cannabis brand!</p>
                    <p>Little Dragon&trade; is a delivery-only dispensary that you shop from your phone!
                    <p>Mobile delivery platforms are an undeniably significant part of the future of cannabis, but as the industry currently stands, most retail purchases still require an in-store visit. We see the absence of reliable cannabis delivery as an opportunity! Instead of spending large proportions of capital on storefront overhead like every other dispensary, we dedicated our resources to building the <strong>BEST mobile app in cannabis</strong> – one that provides a dependable and convenient delivery experience.</p>
                    <p>We built this app because we wanted a cannabis company to give us the same personalized shopping experience that we’re used to when making purchases on other platforms like Amazon and Shop. Since such a platform didn’t exist in the cannabis space, we built it ourselves!</p>

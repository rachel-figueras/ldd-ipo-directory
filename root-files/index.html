                <h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>
                    <p>The forward-looking statements used in our SEC Filing and on our website are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and many of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. No assurance can be made to any investor by anyone that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements will be attained, or that deviations from them will not be material and adverse. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this hereof. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in our SEC Filing or on our website, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise, other than as may be required by applicable law. For further information, please see the Companyâ€™s Form C [HERE].</p>
                <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

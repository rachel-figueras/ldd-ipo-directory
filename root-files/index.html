<!---ABOUT US--->
        <section id="about">
            <div class="full-width">
                <h3>Founded in 2021</h3>
                    <p>Little Dragon Dabs&trade; differentiates itself from other cannabis brands with a unique devotion to dabbers and a commitment to dab culture. As an enterprise, we believe in the philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well. The structure of our operations is propelled by a quantitative, data-driven approach to our target market. Most leading concentrate brands characterize themselves with production-focused monikers such as extracts, labs, and farms. We are unapologetically...<br> Little Dragon <em><u>Dabs</u></em>.</p>
                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                    <p>Ross Franklin, <em>CEO & COO</em> | Rachel Figueras, <em>CTO & CMO</em></p>
                    <p>Both founders are seasoned cannabis entrepreneurs with ten years of cannabis industry experience, from branding & marketing to supply chain management. Prior to founding Little Dragon Dabs&trade;, Ross and Rachel co-invented, patented, and commercially developed a process that turns cannabis oils into a water-soluble powder alongside famed cannabis author and cultivator Ed Rosenthal.</p>
                    <p>After patenting the original powderization process, they went on to write seven additional USPTO-approved patents related to that technology (one of the first groups of cannabis patents ever issued). From there, they branded the consumer product Stardust by Ed Rosenthal&trade;, commercially produced it in a HACCP-compliant facility, and got it placed in over 100 California dispensaries.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, Ross and Rachel successfully exited Stardust - the company, trademarks, and patent portfolio were acquired by a publicly-traded Canadian company. In addition to their success in monetizing their intellectual property, both founders are master-level cannabis cultivators, with their original start in cannabis managing and eventually owning large-scale commercial indoor & outdoor grow operations. Post-exit, they successfully navigated the process to obtain a cannabis manufacturer’s license from the city of Costa Mesa and the State of California in 2019.</p>
                    <p>They each have experience in executive level/upper management careers in the non-cannabis sectors of Architecture &amp; Building Code, Logistics, and International Shipping, and each of them hold two Bachelor’s Degrees in Economics and Public Policy.</p>
                <h3>Market Opportunity: Dabbers</h3>
                    <p>Dabbers are a young demographic, comprised mainly of millennials and Gen-Zers. These generations place far less value on in-store experiences, opting for convenience and technology instead. As online D2C purchasing behavior continues to steadily grow in the U.S. economy as a whole, no other demographic impacts this rising trend more than young generations.</p>
                    <p>The dab market is arguably overlooked and underserved by the cannabis industry because most concentrate brands focus on the production of distillates and oils with a heavy reliance on sales of vaping products. Yet remarkably, nationwide data shows dab products (concentrates exclusive of vape products) boast a market size nearly equal to that of edible products. We find this pattern of data revealing – as an opportunity to fill a market void by providing a personalized technology-driven solution, and become the new home for dab culture.</p>
                <h3>How We Generate Revenue</h3>
                    <p>Pricing | Logistics | Scalability</p>
                    <p>The company will have significantly lower overhead and operational costs as a delivery-only platform when compared to brick-and-mortar retail dispensaries, and creating contract-manufacturing agreements with top extractors eliminates the need for large capital expenditures when the brand expands into new territory. Logistical advantages come from being nimble and single-category focused, allowing us to provide consumers with the lowest-cost options without sacrificing product quality or healthy profit margins.</p>
                    <p>The company is built to thrive in challenging economic environments due to its low overhead and low price point. While circumventing the in-store experience with 100% D2C delivery -exclusively available via mobile- the app will continuously analyze customer purchasing patterns alongside product data, enabling the most informed product selections & creating predictable experiences <em>better</em> than a human budtender.</p>

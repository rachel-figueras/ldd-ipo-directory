                <h3>TYPES OF CONCENTRATES</h3>
                    <p>Concentrates are divided into two main categories: those that are extracts, and those that aren’t. Extracts are made with the use of a solvent, and are often referred to as hash oil. Non-extract concentrates include hash, rosin hash, and kief. Bubble hash is not considered to be an extract, even though it uses water as a solvent (in the world of cannabis, water is not considered a solvent).</p>
                    <p>There are two ways to categorize extracts: according to solvent, and according to consistency. Some solvent-based categories include BHO, which uses butane as a solvent, or PHO, which uses propane as solvent. There's also CO₂-based extractions, which use supercritical CO₂ as solvent, and alcohol-based extracts, which use alcohol, typically in the form of ethanol.</p>
                    <p>Extracts can also be categorized according to consistency. Wax refers to waxy, opaque extracts; sap refers to gooey, transparent extracts; shatter refers to extracts that are hard and transparent like glass; pull 'n' snap refers to extracts with a consistency like toffee; and budder refers to extracts with an opaque, fluffy texture.</p>
                    <p>Different consistencies can be achieved by varying the speed and conditions under which the extract cools during production. Budder, for example, can be made by “whipping” the extract on its cooling plate. Contrary to popular belief, consistency has little effect on an extract’s psychotropic or medicinal properties.</p>

				<h3>POTENCY OF CONCENTRATES</h3>
                    <p>Concentrates work by breaking open the delicate trichomes of the cannabis flower and compressing their contents together. As such, they’re rich in cannabinoids and terpenes, which provide the effects of cannabis.</p>
                    <p>Concentrates are popular for two reasons: one, they tend to be far higher in THC than leading cannabis strains, providing far more of an intoxicating punch. Two, they tend to be richer in medicinal cannabinoids and terpenes, thereby enhancing the medicinal effects of cannabis.</p>
                    <p>Potency is a concentrate’s greatest strength, but also its greatest danger. Inexperienced users may find themselves overwhelmed by their first dab, perhaps knocked into the throes of paranoia or unpleasant feeling. As such, those new to concentrates should begin with small doses and proceed with caution.</p>

				<h3>STRAIN SELECTION</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important choices in the process of making concentrates is which strain to start with. Just as you can’t pull blood from a stone, you can’t pull THC from a zero-THC strain, for example.</p>
                    <p>There are a few basic dimensions to consider when picking a strain. The first is where the strain falls along the indica-sativa spectrum—indicas tend to be more relaxing, with powerful body effects that can spark both hunger and sleepiness. Sativas tend to be more energising, producing a “head high” that can be uplifting, creativity-inducing, and at times anxiogenic. It’s also important to pay attention to a strain’s THC levels—which determine the strength of its psychotropic effects—and CBD levels, as CBD is tied up with many of the medicinal effects of cannabis.</p>
                    <p>If you’re looking for a high-THC strain, you can’t go wrong with Royal Gorilla. This balanced indica/sativa hybrid clocks in at a staggering 30% THC—truly off the charts. If you’re looking to use your concentrate to treat a medicinal issue like chronic pain, anxiety, or epilepsy, you’d likely want to start with a strain that’s high in CBD. Euphoria is a great choice, being an indica-dominant strain with 7% CBD. A very different but also strong choice is Painkiller XL, a sativa-dominant strain with carefully balanced levels of THC and CBD.</p>

                <h3>HOW TO CONSUME CONCENTRATES</h3>
                    <p>Concentrates can be consumed in several ways. They can be baked into edibles using similar methods to those used for cannabis flower. They can also be added to cannabis  joints or bowls for a boost of potency. The most common way to consume concentrates is by vaping or dabbing. There are many ways to vaporize concentrates, but vape pens are an especially popular method. In fact, vape pens are the leading method for consuming store-bought CO₂ concentrates. Vape pens are discreet, simple to use, and tend to provide a milder, more "manageable" high. On the other hand, dabbing is a method wherein a concentrate substance is placed on a hot nail and its vapor is inhaled through bong-like glassware called a “dab rig." It is a method reserved for the most experienced cannabis connoiseurs and those with high tolerance levels/potency needs.</p>

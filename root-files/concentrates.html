                <h3>EXTRACTION</h3>
                    <p>Concentrates are divided into two main categories: those that are extracts, and those that aren’t. Extracts are made with the use of a solvent, and are often referred to as hash oil. Non-extract concentrates include hash, rosin hash, and kief. Bubble hash is not considered to be an extract, even though it uses water as a solvent (in the world of cannabis, water is not considered a solvent).</p>
                    <p>There are two ways to categorize extracts: according to solvent, and according to consistency. Some solvent-based methods include BHO (butane as a solvent), CO₂-based extractions, which use supercritical CO₂, and alcohol-based extracts in which ethanol is typically the solvent used.</p>
                    <p>Solventless, or solvent-free extracts are considered by some to be more "clean" or pure vs. solvent-based methods. Even though all solvents are completely filtered out during the extraction process, some consumers prefer an "unadultered" finished product. That's why Little Dragon Dabs&trade; are always solvent-free from beginning to end for a clean and potent high.</p>
                    <p>Extracts can also be categorized according to consistency. Wax refers to waxy, opaque extracts; sap refers to gooey, transparent extracts; shatter refers to extracts that are hard and transparent like glass; pull 'n' snap refers to extracts with a consistency like toffee; and budder/badder refers to extracts with an opaque, fluffy texture.</p>
                    <p>Different consistencies can be achieved by varying the speed and conditions under which the extract cools during production. Budder, for example, can be made by “whipping” the extract on its cooling plate. Contrary to popular belief, consistency has little effect on an extract’s psychoactive or medicinal properties.</p>

				<h3>POTENCY</h3>
                    <p>Concentrates work by breaking open the delicate trichomes of the cannabis flower and compressing their contents together. As such, they’re rich in cannabinoids and terpenes.</p>
                    <p>Concentrates are popular for two reasons: one, they tend to be far higher in THC than leading cannabis strains, providing far more of an intoxicating punch. Two, they tend to be richer in other cannabinoids and terpenes, thereby enhancing the medicinal effects of cannabis.</p>
                    <p>Potency is a concentrate’s greatest strength, but also its greatest danger. Inexperienced users may find themselves overwhelmed by their first dab, perhaps knocked into the throes of paranoia or unpleasant feelings. As such, those new to concentrates should begin with small doses and proceed with caution.</p>

				<h3>STRAIN SELECTION</h3>
                    <p>There are a few basic dimensions to consider when picking a strain. The first is where the strain falls along the indica-sativa spectrum—indicas tend to be more relaxing, with powerful body effects that can spark both hunger and sleepiness. Sativas tend to be more energizing, producing a “head high” that can be uplifting, creativity-inducing, and at times anxiogenic. It’s also important to pay attention to a strain’s THC levels—which determine the strength of its psychoactive effects—and CBD levels, as CBD is linked to many of the medicinal effects of cannabis.</p>
                    <p>There are an infinite amount of cannabis strains and new ones appear on menus every week. Even the most seasoned cannabis consumer can struggle to decipher them all and with variabilities in aroma, taste, and mind/body effect, predictable consumption experiences can be a bit of a quagmire.</p>
